## Topic 

### *Computer Vision* 🤖

Image encoding to vector space.

## Project description



### Idea 🖼️
The core idea is to encode the image to a vector space for future proximity search and clustering.

In particular, I am interested in painting. Imagine painting something and then finding out which style, years, school, or authors it is most similar to.

### Model and Techniques 🔧
The current plan is to train/fine-tune CNN with Contrast learning techniques to create an Image encoder. Later, some locality approximation algorithms will be used to optimize search and clustering.

### Data 💾
Data will be collected (scrapped) from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/index.html), which has approximately 50,000 art pieces and 6,000 authors. Of course, some additional sources might be considered.

## Project type 

### *Hybrid*
Combination of **Bring your data** and **Bring your method**.
