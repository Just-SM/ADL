## Topic 

### *Computer Vision* ü§ñ

Image encoding to vector space.

## Project description



### Idea üñºÔ∏è
The core idea is to encode the image to a vector space for future proximity search and clustering.

In particular, I am interested in painting. Imagine painting something and then finding out which style, years, school, or authors it is most similar to.

### Model and Techniques üîß
The current plan is to fine-tune CNN with Contrast learning techniques to create an Image encoder. Later, NN algorithm is used to search for similar paintings. Final results of clarification resolved by majority voting of neighbors.

### Data üíæ
Data will be collected (scrapped) from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/index.html), which has approximately 50,000 art pieces and 6,000 authors. Of course, some additional sources might be considered.

## Project type 

### *Hybrid*
Combination of **Bring your data** and **Bring your method**.
